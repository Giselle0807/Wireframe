  <p>My coding journey is just beginning.I started coding a few months ago, starting with some basic HTML and CSS.I'm excited to learn more about javascript as well.I have been  creating small web pages on Github to start off and have been satisfied with the outcome of them.Overall I'm just open and willing to but in the effort to learn new coding languages. </p>
